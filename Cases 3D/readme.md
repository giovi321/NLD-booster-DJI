# Cases for booster module external install
The following files are 3D printable cases to allow installing externally the booster module and step-down module.
All cases should be printed in ABS given its higher resistance to high temperatures compared to PLA

## Additional components
All cases need some additional hardware in order to be able to use them:
- A velcro strap to tie the case to the drone (typically on top of the drone)
- 2mm thick neoprene strips
- A long enough female ipex4 to female ipex4 cable (10 or 15 cm should be enough, available on aliexpress)

Plastic cases need the following additional hardware:
- 4x threaded inserts M2x4x3.2
- 4x screws M2x6
- Heatsinks designed for Raspberry Pi (available on [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007485448259.html) or [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YR6M6F6/))
  - 4x heatsinks 14x14mm
  - 1x heatsink 14x9mm

## Cases available
### Plastic case
The most basic and simple solution: mostly designed for use with DJI Mini 2, but compatible will all drones.

### Plastic case with battery
If you don't want to solder anything to your drone, this is the solution.

Additional components needed:
- USB type C female connector with breakout board (available on [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004861928502.html))
- 403040 LiPo 3.7V (at least 500mAh) battery

### Aluminum case
This case is probably the best solution as it is completely waterproof. However, it need to be CNC machined (or 3D printed in metal) which is more expensive.
This case does not need any heatsink as it is already embedded in the case. However, you'll need thermal paste or glue to attach the board to the case itself.
